# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio
## Description
The following webpage was designed using minimal CSS stylings and focusing on Bootstrap's components in order to create a responsive layout.  The page consists of a responsive navbar, images, and text fields.  The page provides a brief description of the developer himself, Ryan Curtin.
## Developer
Bootstrap's grid system was applied on all three html files in order to create a responsive layout.  The navbar that is apparent on all three pages is consistent with all links working appropriately.  There were no media queries used to create the responsiveness on each page, only Bootstrap's components were utilized.  The personalization was provided by the developer, Ryan Curtin.  The footer is in a fixed position on all three pages.  Comments are provided extensively on the html and css files.  CSS was used minimally to custom background colors and other stylings.  HTML semantics are applied on all three pages.  Developer is in early stages of learning to code, please mind the abundant commits!
